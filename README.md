## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Node.js 20.9+** (required for Next.js 16)
- **Dodo Payments account** (to access API and Webhook Keys from dashboard)

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lupleg/dodo-payment-nextjs.git
cd dodo-payment-nextjs
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Get API Credentials

Sign up at [Dodo Payments](https://dodopayments.com/) and get your credentials from the dashboard:

- **API Key:** [Dashboard → Developer → API Keys](https://app.dodopayments.com/developer/api-keys)
- **Webhook Key:** [Dashboard → Developer → Webhooks](https://app.dodopayments.com/developer/webhooks)

> Make sure you're in **Test Mode** while developing!

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Update the values with your Dodo Payments credentials:

```env
DODO_PAYMENTS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
DODO_PAYMENTS_WEBHOOK_KEY=your_webhook_signing_key_here
DODO_PAYMENTS_RETURN_URL=http://localhost:3000
DODO_PAYMENTS_ENVIRONMENT=test_mode
```

### 5. Add Your Products

Update `src/lib/products.ts` with your actual product IDs from Dodo Payments:

```typescript
export const products: Product[] = [
  {
    product_id: "pdt_001", // Replace with your product ID
    name: "Basic Plan",
    description: "Get access to basic features and support",
    price: 9999, // in cents
    features: [
      "Access to basic features",
      "Email support",
      "1 Team member",
      "Basic analytics",
    ],
  },
  // ... add more products
];
```

### 6. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your pricing page!

```

## Customization

### Update Product Information

Edit `src/lib/products.ts` to modify:
- Product IDs (from your Dodo dashboard)
- Pricing
- Features
- Descriptions

### Pre-fill Customer Data

In `src/app/components/ProductCard.tsx`, replace the hardcoded values with your actual user data:

```typescript
customer: {
  name: "John Doe",
  email: "john@example.com",
},
```

### Update Customer Portal Link

In `src/app/components/Header.tsx`, replace the hardcoded customer ID:

```typescript
const CUSTOMER_ID = "cus_001"; // Replace with actual customer ID
```

## Webhook Events

The boilerplate demonstrates handling two webhook events in `src/app/api/webhook/route.ts`:

- `onSubscriptionActive` - Triggered when a subscription becomes active
- `onPaymentSucceeded` - Triggered when a payment is successful

Add your business logic inside these handlers:

```typescript
onSubscriptionActive: async (payload) => {
  // Grant access to your product
  // Update user database
  // Send welcome email
},
```

Add more webhook events as needed.

For local development, you can use tools like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to create a secure tunnel to your local server and use it as your webhook URL. Remember to update your `.env` file with the correct webhook verification key.

## Deployment

### Build for Production

npm run build
npm start
